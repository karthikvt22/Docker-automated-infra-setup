## Error: Permission Denied on Docker Socket

### Cause:
This error occurs when the current user does not have permission to access the Docker socket. Specifically, the user may not be part of the Docker group or lacks the necessary permissions to interact with Docker.

### Solution:
Follow the steps below to resolve the issue:

1. **Add the current user to the Docker group**:
   Run the following command to add the current user to the Docker group:

 - sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

2.Apply the new group membership:
  - newgrp docker

3.If the issue persists, change the permissions of the Docker socket:
  - sudo chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock
  - sudo chmod 660 /var/run/docker.sock

4. Verify the fix by command
   - docker ps

5. Network Unreachable
- Problem: The script tried to access a network resource, but the network was unreachable.
- Way out:Solution: Check your network connection, ensure that the system can access the external resources (e.g., via ping or curl), and verify the correct IP/hostname configuration.

To Check Docker Service Status -- sudo systemctl status docker
